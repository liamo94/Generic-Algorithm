# Generic-Algorithm
Generic Algorithm (evolution) written in numerous coding languages:

  __LANGUAGES__
  * C++
  * C#
  * Go
  * Java
  * JavaScipt
  * Kotlin
  * Ruby
  * Perl
  * PHP
  * Python
  * Swift
  * Typescript
   
 __Pseudocode:__
  ```
  Create inital population of POP_SIZE
  Calculate fitness
  WHILE string not made
    Selection
    Crossover
    Mutate
    Re-compute fitness
  RETURN NUMBER OF STEPS
```
  
This project was a challenge I set myself to write the same piece of code over as many languages as possible to see the differences. The code uses arrays, ints, strings, while loops, for loops, conditional logic and objects so I believe it was a great comparison of a small subsets of some of the features the languages have to offer. This was not to showcase best practices or the optimal solution for all languages (at least for the ones I am less familar with), but rather enforce the idea that all modern languages follow similar flows.
